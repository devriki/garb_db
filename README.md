# All databases are garbage

The problem with databases these days is that they promise too much.

> DB X is Highly Available. DB Y is eventually consistent.

But they all **lie** and are actually garbage.

## GarbDB is honest

When you use Garb-db, you're never surprised by how it fails because it promises you nothing:

- No promise of availability
- No promise of consistency
- Not distributed
- No Promise of keeping your data

## Garb-db is simple to debug

The source code is less than 30 lines, so there are very few possible errors to deal with.
